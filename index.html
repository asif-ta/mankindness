                <h1> THE PLACE <br>
                    EVERY THING <br>
                    STARTED</h1>
                <p>
                    Every journey begins somewhere, and mine started with a single photograph. It wasn’t an award-winning shot, nor was it taken with an expensive camera. It was a simple picture—an old wooden pier stretching into the ocean, waves gently lapping against the sides, and a sky that seemed to be whispering secrets only I could hear. That moment, frozen in time, changed everything. <br>
                    I was sixteen when I took that photo. It was a summer evening, and I had just borrowed my uncle’s old film camera. Something about looking through the viewfinder made me feel like I was seeing the world for the first time. That’s when I knew—I had to capture more. <br>
                    For years, photography remained my quiet obsession. I took my camera everywhere, clicking away at city streets, towering mountains, and the faces of people who didn’t know they were telling a story with just a glance. It wasn’t just about taking pictures; it was about finding moments that would otherwise be lost to time. <br>
                    The real turning point came during a trip to the Himalayas. I had saved for two years just to afford the plane ticket, and I still remember stepping off onto foreign soil, my camera clutched tightly in my hands. There, amidst towering peaks and winding trails, I met a group of nomads. They lived in small wooden houses built along the cliffs, 
                    their lives dictated by the seasons and the will of nature. I spent days with them, learning their ways, sharing meals, and capturing their essence through my lens. When I developed those images, I saw something I hadn’t before—real stories, real emotion, real life. <br>
                    That was the moment I realized my photographs weren’t just pictures; they were memories, echoes of the past, windows into lives beyond my own. And I wanted to share that. I wanted others to see what I saw, feel what I felt, and experience the world the way I had—through the lens of adventure, emotion, and light. <br>
                    That’s how this website was born. A place where I could bring my journeys, my stories, and my passion for photography together. This isn’t just a collection of pictures—it’s a chronicle of everything that has led me here, to this moment, to this passion that refuses to fade.
                    So welcome to my world. Welcome to the place everything started. <br>

                <h2>A SPECIAL JOURNEY</h2>
                <p class="firstP">It started with a map—an old, tattered piece of parchment I found in a small antique shop in Morocco. Faded ink lines traced an unfamiliar route, snaking through valleys and across mountains, leading to a place I had never heard of: Eldoria. The shopkeeper, a man with deep wrinkles and a knowing smile, simply said, “If you follow this path, you may find what you’re looking for.” <br>
                    I didn’t know what I was looking for, but something in me said I had to go. And so, with a camera slung over my shoulder and a backpack filled with little more than hope, I set off on what would become the most extraordinary journey of my life. <br>
                    The journey began in the dusty streets of Marrakech, where the scent of spices clung to the air, and the call to prayer echoed through the alleys. From there, I made my way into the Atlas Mountains, hitching rides with nomads and following roads that grew narrower and less traveled with each step.
                    Days turned into weeks. I crossed deserts where the heat played tricks on my vision, making the sand shimmer like a golden sea. I wandered through villages untouched by time, where children laughed as they chased goats and elders told stories that seemed older than the mountains themselves. I slept under the stars, listening to the wind whisper secrets through the canyons, and I woke to sunrises that painted the sky in hues I had never seen before. <br>
                    Then came the jungle. It was dense, alive, humming with the sound of creatures unseen. I followed the map’s path through thick vines and endless green until I found myself standing before an ancient stone archway, half-swallowed by nature. This was Eldoria—or at least what remained of it. <br>
                    Beyond the arch, ruins stretched before me, their carvings telling stories of a forgotten civilization. Statues of beings with wings and elongated faces stood guard over courtyards reclaimed by the forest. I wandered through the remains, my camera clicking at every turn, desperate to capture the mystery that surrounded me. <br>
                    Then I heard it—a deep, resonant hum, like the echo of something ancient stirring from sleep. I followed the sound to a chamber where a pool of water, impossibly clear, reflected the carvings above. At its center, a single stone stood, etched with symbols I didn’t understand. But in that moment, I didn’t need to. I felt it—the weight of history, the presence of those who had walked these halls before me. <br>
                </p>
                <img src="img/temple.png" alt="this is a temple picture">
                <p class="secondP">I don’t know how long I stayed there. Time felt irrelevant. When I finally emerged from the ruins, my heart was pounding, my mind racing with a thousand unanswered questions. Eldoria was real. And though I didn’t fully understand its story, I had become a part of it. <br>
                    That journey changed me. It reminded me that the world is full of mysteries waiting to be uncovered, stories waiting to be told. And though I left Eldoria behind, its spirit traveled with me, living on in the photographs I captured, in the memories I hold, and in the endless search for the next great adventure.
                    Because some journeys don’t end—they simply lead to the next one.</p>

                <img src="img/ownerPic.png" alt="this is owner pic">
                <p>Every photograph is a frozen moment, a story whispered through light and shadow. My journey into photography wasn’t just about capturing images—it was about capturing emotions, untold stories, and the fleeting beauty of the world around us. <br>
                    It all started with a simple camera, a restless curiosity, and an endless desire to see the world differently. From quiet streets at dawn to towering mountains bathed in golden light, I have wandered through places and moments, framing them in ways that speak beyond words. Photography became more than a passion; it became my language, my way of expressing everything I felt but couldn’t say. <br>
                    Through this page, I share my adventures, my discoveries, and my perspective. Each click of the shutter is a heartbeat, a second that will never come again, but through my lens, it lives forever. <br>
                    Welcome to my world of captured moments—where every photograph holds a story waiting to be told.</p>
